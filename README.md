Excel-based analysis of 2024–25 NBA player stats using pivot tables and player lookup tools
NBA Player Statistics Analysis (2024–25 Season)
This project analyzes NBA player statistics from the 2024–25 season using Excel. The goal was to explore player performance through league benchmarks, clutch performance comparisons, and positional averages, while building an interactive way to look up player stats.

Project Overview
•	Cleaned and organized raw NBA player data from Basketball-Reference.com
•	Built pivot tables to calculate league averages and positional benchmarks.
•	Designed a dropdown lookup tool to view individual player “clutch” stats compared to league averages.
Created summary tables for:
•	Top player averages vs league averages
•	Efficiency leaders
•	3-point and free-throw performance
•	Team average age vs average points

Key Metrics
The project highlights common basketball performance measures, including:
•	Field Goal % (FG%)
•	3-Point % (3P%)
•	Free Throw % (FT%)
•	Assists-to-Turnover Ratio (AST/TO)Points per Game (PPG)
•	Rebounds (REB)
•	Player Efficiency Metrics
Players are evaluated against:
•	League averages (is a player better/worse than average?)
•	Standard performance benchmarks (e.g., 40%+ 3PT = excellent).

Interactive Features
•	Dropdown Player Lookup: Select a player to see their clutch-relevant stats compared to the league.
•	Conditional Formatting: Highlights strengths/weaknesses automatically.
•	Pivot Tables: Enable quick comparisons across positions, teams, and the league.

Skills Demonstrated
•	Data cleaning and transformation in Excel
•	Pivot tables and calculated metrics
•	Use of conditional formatting for insights
•	Comparative analysis (league averages vs player benchmarks)
•	Presenting sports analytics in a user-friendly way

Files
2024-25 NBA Player Stats.xlsx – full Excel workbook with all analysis, pivot tables, and dashboards.

Future Improvements
•	Publish interactive dashboards in Tableau or Power BI.
•	Add advanced metrics like PER, Usage Rate, or Clutch Time stats (if available).
•	Automate updates with Python or SQL.

How to Use
•	Download the Excel file.
•	Open the Clutch-Relevant Stats tab to explore individual player stats.
•	Use pivot tables to explore league-wide trends.
